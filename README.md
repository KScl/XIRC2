XIRC2
=====

XIRC2 IRC Bot framework, used for Fortuna (badniknet/#fortune) and Kikyo (esper/#srb2fun)

To run from the command line, use `php x.php`.

Configuration notes:
* All configuration files must reside in "/settings/".
* "example.ini" is an example configuration file that hopefully should give you enough info to set up the bot normally.
* The default configuration file is "options.txt", which doesn't exist normally.
* To use a different configuration file, specify the file name in the command line arguments: `php x.php fortune.txt`
